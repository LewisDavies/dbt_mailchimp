# Mailchimp 

This package models Mailchimp data from Fivetran's data connector. 

[Here](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/package-management) is some additional 
information about packages in dbt. If you haven't already, you will need to create
a `packages.yml` file in your project and supply the git link from this repository.
You should then copy the adwords package structure from the `dbt_project.yml` in
this repository into your project's `dbt_project.yml` file and replace the `#`
values with the adwords table names from your warehouse.
